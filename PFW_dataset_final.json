Sunderman and his team of faculty and students subsequently unearthed the entire mastodon skeleton—along with the skull of a baby mastodon.\n\nLater that year, Steve Pettyjohn, who served as the student body president in 1968–69, wrote a letter to the Communicator, the university newspaper, extolling the virtues of choosing the mastodon as the mascot: “It sounds different, strange. That’s exactly why [we should choose it]. I’m tired of slavishly copying what Bloomington, West Lafayette, and other big schools do. Let’s have the courage to be a little different.”\n\nThe following year, a student government committee selected the Mastodon as the university mascot.

One of the core elements of our programs is a continuous-improvement model that provides feedback to faculty about policies and practices. Purdue Fort Wayne routinely monitors a wide range of program measures, such as student academic progress, completer feedback, and employer satisfaction. Further, we believe it is important to share our data with the public to promote transparency and trust in higher education. Below, we provide four measures used to monitor our initial educator preparation programs. Data for advanced programs can be found on the websites for those specific programs.
